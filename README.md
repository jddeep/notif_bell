# notif_bell

A new flutter plugin project.

THE FRONTEND FOR YOUR APP NOTIFICATIONS.
NotifBell helps you maintain the notifications to your user by just passing some important parameters like size and whether to notify or not.

Use the Widget in your app in this way:

` NotifBell(
                notify: true,
                size: 35.0, // size of the widget.
                notifs: 2,
              ), `

## Getting Started

Android and/or iOS.
